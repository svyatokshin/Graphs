# Describe the problem in graphs terminology
# What are our nodes? numbers/people
# What are our edges? if a descendant/parent
# Directed graph
​
# Build your graph or write getNeighbors()
# Can do either
​
# Choose your fighter!
# Which algorithm in this situation?
### BFS, DFS, BFT, DFT
​
# Search or a traversal?
# More like a traversal: visit every possible from your starting node
​
# Depth vs Breadth
# BF --> shortest path
# DF --> heads to leaves first
​
# DF can be recursive, but not BF
​

def earliest_ancestor(ancestors, starting_node, distance=0):
    pass


​
# iterate over all ancestors,
# add each node to the graph
# add each edge to the graph
​
# run a traversal
​
# modify it so as you go, you keep track of the node that's farthest away
