# directed vs undirected
# one-way street vs two-way streets
# Twitter: directed, FB/LinkedIn: undirected

# 'no circles' vs 'circles'

# weighted vs unweighted
# map with distance/traffic
# Use Dijkstra's algorithm

# Graph applications
# if you can think of a coding problem as a graph, then you can apply these graph algorithms
